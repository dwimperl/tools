Plan for next cycles

1) One-by-one download modules from CPAN, test them and check-them into a repository in tar.gz format
2) Check licenses
3) build internal CPAN server
4) Have a regular cpan installation of "everything" that should be in the package and then 
run all the tests again to see if everything still works.

During the "development" phase enale test reporting to CPAN Testers but not 
during the "testing" phase as the reports are already out. In the "testing" phase
we might want to report only failures but then we should include all the details
of the current list and version numbers of prereqs.

Change the way we install modules so they will go in the vendor directory?
Is that really a good thing for DWIM Perl or shall we keep the separation?

Add PDF::Create

during installation check for another perl installed on the system (either check for strawberry, or perl in the PATH variable or check for perl.exe in the PATH and then ask the user what to do?
1) cancel installation
2) install and put the dwim path at the end
3) put the DWIM path at the beginning
4) remove the other directories
OR at least provid a README on how to change this.
