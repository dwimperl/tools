Plan for next cycles

1) One-by-one download modules from CPAN, test them and check-them intor a repository in tar.gz format
2) Check licenses
3) buildin internal CPAN server
4) Have a regular cpan installation of "everything" that should be in the package.


Change the way we install modules so they will go in the vendor directory?
Is that really a good thing for DWIM Perl or shall we keep the separation?
